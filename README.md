## Tariff Calculation
The electricity units are charged based on the block used. Refer to the table for the rate.

| Block | Charges (sen/kWh) |
|-------|-------------------|
| For the first 200 kWh (1 - 200 kWh) per month | 21.8 |
| For the next 100 kWh (201 - 300 kWh) per month | 33.4 |
| For the next 300 kWh (301 - 600 kWh) per month | 51.6 |
| For the next 600 kWh (601 - 1000 kWh) per month onwards | 54.6 |

**Calculation Formula**:  
`Total Charges = Sum of (Block Usage × Block Rate)`  
`Final Cost = Total Charges - (Total Charges × Rebate Percentage / 100)`
